Imports

1. pyautogui
   
   The purpose of PyAutoGUI is to provide a cross-platform Python module for GUI automation for   
   human beings. The API is designed to be as simple as possible with sensible defaults.

   For example, here is the complete code to move the mouse to the middle of the screen on    
   Windows, OS X, and Linux:

   >>> import pyautogui
   >>> screenWidth, screenHeight = pyautogui.size()
   >>> pyautogui.moveTo(screenWidth / 2, screenHeight / 2)
   And that is all.

   PyAutoGUI can simulate moving the mouse, clicking the mouse, dragging with the mouse,  
   pressing keys, pressing and holding keys, and pressing keyboard hotkey combinations.   

2. webbrowser
   
   The webbrowser module includes functions to open URLs in interactive browser applications. The 
   module includes a registry of available browsers, in case multiple options are available on the 
   system. It can also be controlled with the BROWSER environment variable.

   Simple Example
   To open a page in the browser, use the open() function.

   import webbrowser

   webbrowser.open('http://docs.python.org/lib/module-webbrowser.html')

   The URL is opened in a browser window, and that window is raised to the top of the window  
   stack. The documentation says that an existing window will be reused, if possible, but the   
   actual behavior may depend on your browserâ€™s settings. Using Firefox on my Mac, a new window   
   was always created. 

3. time
  
   It provides functions for working with times, and for converting between representations. 
   The function time.time() returns the current system time in ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 
   1970(epoch).
